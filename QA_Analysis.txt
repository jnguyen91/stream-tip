List of Bugs
1. Login screen has "admin" as a hint for username. Suggest this greyed out text to be "username" instead
2. Search for a gif - Users must click on the search button to inorder to work. Suggest users can also press "enter" key on keyboard to search
3. Or select a gif - Only 10 gifs are to be previewed, suggest to have a slider to preview more gifs
